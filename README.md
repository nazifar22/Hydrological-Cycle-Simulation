# Hydrological-Cycle-Simulation
This program simulates the hydrological cycle of the Earth, where different land areas—Plain, Grassland, and Lakes Region—interact with changing weather based on air humidity. Each area has an owner, a type, and a water amount (in km³). Weather conditions—Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy—are determined by humidity, and each affects the water level and transformation of the areas. For example, plains may become grasslands if water exceeds 15 km³, while grasslands can turn into lakes or revert to plains based on water thresholds. The simulation reads area data and initial humidity from a file, then runs in rounds, updating weather, water, humidity, and area types. It prints the state after each round and ends when all areas are of the same type.

How to Use: Run the application. Enter the input file name (e.g., input.txt) when prompted. The simulation will begin and run round by round, printing: Round number Attributes of each area: Owner Name, Type, WaterAmount Current humidity level Simulation stops when all areas become the same type. A message Simulation is finished! is displayed.
